# Singly Linked List
* Creating methods for singly linked lists.

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored int he Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your `LinkedList` class, include head property.
* Upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created.
* Define a method called `insert`, which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.
* Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called `toString` which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the linked list formatted as: `{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL`
* Define a new method append which takes in a value which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* Define a new method `insertBefore` which takes in a value and a newVal and adds a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* Define a new method `insertAfter` which takes in a value and a newVal and adds a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Insert .
* Includes .
* toString .
* Append .
* insertBefore .
* insertAfter .
* kthFromEnd .
