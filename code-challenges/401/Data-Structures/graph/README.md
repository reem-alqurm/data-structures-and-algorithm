# Graph Implementation

* Implement Graphs and related methods. Implement getEdges function that returns true or false for whether a specified path through the graph is possible. Implement depthFirst function to do preorder traversal on a graph.

# Challenge
* Implement your own graph, should be represented as an adjacency list.
* addNode(): adds a new vertex to the graph, takes in the value of that vertex and returns the added vertex.
* addEdge(): adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph, include ability to have a "weight", takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge.
* getNodes(): returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar).
* getNeighbors(): returns collection of edges connected to the given node, takes in a given node, includes the weight of the connection in the returned collection.
* size(): returns the total number of nodes in the graph.
*  Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.
* Write a business trip function, that takes in a graph and an array of city names. Return whether the full trip if possible , and if so how much it would cost.

# Approach & Efficiency
* Created Vertex, Edge, and Graph classes and constructors.
* Created methods for addVertex(vertex), addEdge(startVertex, endVertex, weight), getNeighbors(vertex).
* Also created methods for both breadth first traversal as well as depth first traversal.
* Created size method that traverses the graph and returns the number of vertices.
* Created a business trip function, that takes in a graph and an array of city names. Return whether the full trip if possible , and if so how much it would cost.
