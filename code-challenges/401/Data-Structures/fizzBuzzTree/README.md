# FizzBuzz Tree

* Conduct "FizzBuzz" on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree. Set the values of each new node depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

# Challenge
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
* Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
* Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”.
  * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”.
  * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”.
  * If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

# Approach & Efficiency
  * O(n) time / O(k) space
