# Insertion Sort
 * Review the provided pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

# Challenge
 * Write a blog post stepping through the insertion sort algorithm Code a working, tested implementation of insertion sort based on the provided pseudocode.
# Approach & Efficiency
 * Stepped through the algorithm step by step visually and then using the provided pseudocode to implement working code.
# Big O 
 * O(n^2) time / O(1) space
