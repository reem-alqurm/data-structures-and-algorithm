# Merge Sort
* Merge sort is a sorting algorithm based off of the concept of divide and conquer to sort. It breaks down the array into smaller arrays, sorts them, and then merges everything back together.

# Steps
* The array is [38,27,43,3,9,82,10].

* Step 1: Split the array in half, based on the array.length/2. 
* Step 2: Continue dividing the subarrays until left with only single element arrays. 
* Step 3: Starting with the single element arrays, merge the sorted subarrays.
* Step 4: Repeat until all merged into a single sorted array.
